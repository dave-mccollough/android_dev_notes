# How a mobile OS Works

The mobile OS is designed to coordinate communications that occur between the hardware and apps of mobile devices.

**Mobile operating systems**
A mobile OS typically starts up when a device powers on, displaying different application icons and user interface (UI) elements to users. The overall experience of the application and swiping or tapping is managed by the mobile OS.

The major function of mobile operating systems is to allow smartphones, tablets, personal digital assistants (PDAs) and other handheld devices to run applications. The OS provides a channel with which applications can access device resources such as the processor, memory, Wi-Fi, Bluetooth and more. Most of the mobile operating systems in the market are based on open (Android) or closed source (iOS) software.

## Popular mobile operating systems

**Android**
Android is a mobile OS that was released in 2008.

Android is based on a modified version of the Linux kernel, which is the foundation of the Linux computer OS and other open-source software. This is software that anyone can use or modify. The Android OS is built primarily for smartphones, Chromebook, Android TV, Android Auto, as well as wearables such as smartwatches.

**iOS**
iOS is Appleâ€™s proprietary OS that runs on the iPhone, iPad and other mobile devices. iOS gives users a multitouch feel, meaning that all user input is via touch gesturing. Similar to Android, through several actions such as swiping, pulling and tapping, users can seamlessly interact with the screen. With built-in sensors such as gyroscopes and accelerometers, Apple devices allow users to switch between the orientations of applications when tilting the devices.
