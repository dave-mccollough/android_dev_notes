# Android platforms

**Chromebook**
Chromebooks are portable laptops that have support for running Android apps, which gives them more features beyond that of a conventional laptop in the market. Notably, Chromebooks operate on Google's ChromeOS.

**Android TV**
Android TV is designed to bring the mobile experience you enjoy on your smartphone right to your TV.

**Android Auto**
Every year, car manufacturers roll out new cars with improved features. This is because, once a car model has been launched, it becomes difficult for manufacturers to keep up with future improvements in navigation and entertainment systems. As a result, drivers are likely to use their phones instead.

**WearOS**
WearOS is Google's Android OS that is specifically designed to power smartwatches and other wearables.
