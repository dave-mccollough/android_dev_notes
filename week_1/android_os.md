Android OS allows you to further personalize your home screen the way you like it. While users have the capability to make adjustments to their experience, there are some limits to what you can do.

Google provides a seamless way for Android operating system users to download apps on their devices. This way, users can unlock the full potential of the Android operating system.

**Custom ROMs**
One major feature that distinguishes Android from Apple devices is the ability to run customized and modified versions of the Android operating system to enjoy both user interface experience changes and access to features of a recent operating system on an older device.

**The Android OS architecture**
The Android OS architecture is made up of different components that any Android device needs to function effectively. Android software is built on top of an open-source Linux kernel and many other C or C++ libraries exposed via application framework services.
